# Best-Arm Identification in Continuous Spaces with Lipschitz Rewards

This repository focuses on a **best-arm identification (BAI)** algorithm in the context of **multi-armed bandits (MABs)** with **Lipschitz-continuous reward functions** defined over a continuous action space.

Multi-armed bandit problems are a class of sequential decision-making problems where an agent balances exploration and exploitation to maximize cumulative reward or identify the best action (arm). In continuous spaces, the challenge becomes more intricate as the number of possible arms is uncountable, and the reward function's smoothness must be leveraged for efficient decision-making.

### Key Concepts

1. **Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs)**:
   - MABs involve selecting an action (arm) from a set of possible actions and observing a stochastic reward.
   - The agent seeks to identify the arm with the highest expected reward or maximize cumulative rewards over time.

2. **Best-Arm Identification (BAI)**:
   - The objective is to identify the arm that maximizes the expected reward within a fixed budget of interactions or with a predefined confidence level.
   - BAI is critical in settings where deploying the best solution has high stakes (e.g., drug testing, hyperparameter optimization).

3. **Lipschitz Continuity**:
   - Reward functions are assumed to be Lipschitz continuous, meaning the difference in rewards between two arms is bounded by a constant times the distance between them.
   - This smoothness assumption allows the agent to generalize information from explored regions to unexplored ones.
